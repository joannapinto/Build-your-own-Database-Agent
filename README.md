# Build-your-own-Database-Agent
Here, you will develop an AI agent that interacts with databases using natural language, simplifying the process for querying and extracting insights.

What you’ll do in this course:

Learn about the levels of knowledge customization with Azure OpenAI Service, focusing on RAG to build your first AI agent, deploy your Azure OpenAI Service instance, test the API, and set up an orchestration engine like LangChain to enable these scenarios.

Load tabular data from a CSV file and perform natural language queries using the Azure OpenAI service to extract information quickly. Learn to reapply the agent to analyze your own CSV files.

Implement LangChain agents to connect to a provided SQL database, and how to build a DB agent that translates natural language to SQL code.

Use Azure OpenAI Service’s function calling feature to use pre-built functions for sending queries to databases, improving the efficiency and security of your SQL agent.

Work with the Assistants API and test it with the function calling and code interpreter features, which will enable you to connect to SQL databases and create your own DB agents more efficiently.
